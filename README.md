a godot project to allow standalone quests to draw on a virtual tablet with krita,
this dogshit project was vibecoded with the use of Cursor's auto mode and used krita's source code to run krita within godot,
this project is a one done deal meant to only be used by me and will not be updated/maintained by me if some other crakhead decides to make a similair project without ai use/fork or whatever with that instead.
